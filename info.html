                    Recently fallen from space, you play a slime blob who has only two objectives 
                    in life. Cover everything in slime, and consume humans.
            </p>
        <h1 class="info-story">INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
            <p class="story-text">
                The goal is to cover every accessible tile of the board before consuming the human at the end.<br>
                Use the arrow keys to move the blob around the level filling the board as you go.<br>
                BEWARE<br>
                Your slime trail is toxic. Going over your own trail will ultimately result in a GAME OVER.<br>
                Failure to fill the whole board before eating the human will also result in a GAME OVER
            </p>
