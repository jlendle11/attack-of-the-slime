## Description and user story
-This is a basic 'fill the board' puzzle game. You play a green slime, who needs to consume humans to survive, covering everything in slime on the way. Fill all the spots on the board before covering the human to win. I've always enjoyed 'fill the board' puzzle games so this is my take on it.

## Technologies & packages
- vanilla JS, CSS, HTML5, NPM, ESLINT

## Launch/build   
#### To run the game:  
-Fork then copy the repo.  
-Clone it to repo of your choice.    
-Open the game folder in your preferred text editor.  
-Right click on index.html, and open it in your preferred browser.

## Major problems & solutions
-Setting the win condition, getting the next level to load after said win condition is met.


## MVP
-Complete game with main menu, working levels, and end screens, good and bad.  
-I plan on adding a tutorial page, more levels, better collision detection and cleaner code.
